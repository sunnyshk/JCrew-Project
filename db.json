Inspired by our best-selling lady jacket, this polished, collarless style is made to be layered under heavier coats for multiseason wear. This latest edition comes with a sweet piping detail, plus eye-catching blooms from Liberty (the British print house known for its mood-lifting florals since 1875). But our favorite part has to be that it's crafted from organic cotton fabric and filled with PrimaLoft, a down alternative that both keeps you warm and keeps plastic bottles out of oceans and landfills.",
